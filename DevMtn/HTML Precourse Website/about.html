    <p>Founded in 2017, Andrew's coding career began as a rocky start coding his first blog with HTML & CSS.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly, his initial project was shaky and full of errors and sloppy code, but nonetheless he persisted. He had the goal in mind of becoming the greatest developer Andrew could possibly become.</p>
    <p>As of July 2018, Drew is now enrolled in a web developer bootcamp with DevMountain and plans to further his developer career into a passion and successful endeavor.</p>
